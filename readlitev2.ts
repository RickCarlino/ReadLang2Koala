I am a language learner and the passage above contains words I did not know, enclosed in square brackets.
I want you to take these unknown words and convert them to example sentences for my spaced repetition system.
Try to make the example about a topic similar to the main text.
Sentence fragments are OK if they can be cleanly translated into English.
The example sentences must contain 2 to 5 Korean words (English word count does not matter).
The sentences are not usable if they do not meet this requirement and you have failed at the task.

After you create the sentence:

1. Make sure it has more than one Korean word.
2. Make sure it has less than six Korean words
3. Conjugate all verbs to their ìš” form.
4. Create an example sentence for every phrase, not just some phrases. I expect ${seenBracketedWords.size} example sentences.
